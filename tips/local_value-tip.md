### The rules of local variable
- the local variable is defined in the code block
	+ define in function block
	+ define in sentence block
	+ define between any '{' and '}'

- if a variable does not exist before the code block when the program runs into the block,then while program leaving the block, the variable become invalid.
- the variable which is defined out of the block and the defined area is before the code block, will be still valid in the block.
